This paper is a contribution to understanding what properties should a topological algebra on a Stone space satisfy to be profinite. We reformulate and simplify proofs for some known properties using syntactic congruences. We also clarify the role of various alternative ways of describing syntactic congruences, namely by finite sets of terms and by compact sets of continuous self mappings of the algebra.

Inspired by a series of papers initiated in 2015 by Berthé et al., we introduce a new condition called suffix-connectedness. We show that the groups generated by the return sets of a uniformly recurrent suffix-connected language lie in a single conjugacy class of subgroups of the free group. Moreover, the rank of the subgroups in this conjugacy class only depends on the number of connected components in the extension graph of the empty word. We also show how to explicitly compute a representative of this conjugacy class using the first order Rauzy graph. Finally, we provide an example of suffix-connected, uniformly recurrent language that contains infinitely many disconnected words.

We describe the pronilpotent quotients of a class of projective profinite groups, that we call ω-presented groups, defined using a special type of presentations. The pronilpotent quotients of an ω-presented group are completely determined by a single polynomial, closely related with the characteristic polynomial of a matrix. We deduce that ω-presented groups are either perfect or admit the p-adic integers as quotients for cofinitely many primes. We also find necessary conditions for absolute and relative freeness of ω-presented groups. Our main motivation comes from semigroup theory: the maximal subgroups of free profinite monoids corresponding to primitive substitutions are ω-presented (a theorem due to Almeida and Costa). We are able to show that the composition matrix of a primitive substitution carries partial information on the pronilpotent quotients of the corresponding maximal subgroup. We apply this to deduce that the maximal subgroups corresponding to primitive aperiodic substitutions of constant length are not absolutely free.

Our main goal is to study the freeness of Schützenberger groups defined by primitive substitutions. Our findings include a simple freeness test for these groups, which is applied to exhibit a primitive invertible substitution with corresponding non-free Schützenberger group. This constitutes a counterexample to a result of Almeida dating back to 2005. We also give some early results concerning relative freeness of Schützenberger groups, a question which remains largely unexplored.

We consider the question of whether or not a given primitive substitution preserves its sets of return words—or return sets for short. More precisely, we study the property asking that the image of the return set to a word equals the return set to the image of that word. We show that, for bifix encodings (where images of letters form a bifix code), this property holds for all but finitely many words. On the other hand, we also show that every conjugacy class of Sturmian substitutions contains a member for which the property fails infinitely often. Various applications and examples of these results are presented, including a description of the subgroups generated by the return sets in the shift of the Thue–Morse substitution. Up to conjugacy, these subgroups can be sorted into strictly decreasing chains of isomorphic subgroups weaving together a simple pattern. This is in stark contrast with the Sturmian case, and more generally with the dendric case (including in particular the Arnoux–Rauzy case), where it is known that all return sets generate the free group over the underlying alphabet.

This thesis aims to shed some light on the structure of maximal subgroups of free profinite monoids corresponding to minimal shift spaces. These groups, which came to be known as <i>Schützenberger groups</i> in the literature, were first studied by Almeida in the early 2000s. They provide a fruitful connection between semigroup theory and symbolic dynamics. But despite many significant advances taking place in the last two decades, our understanding of these groups remains sparse. This thesis proposes a number of contributions on different aspects of this topic, organized in three parts. <p>

The first part is concerned with the freeness question: when are these groups free, be it in the category of profinite groups, or relative to some pseudovariety of finite groups? This part of the thesis focuses in particular on the maximal subgroups corresponding to primitive substitutions. One of the main results is a criterion for absolute freeness which uses a special kind of profinite presentations introduced by Almeida and Costa, which we call <i>ω-presentations</i>. The criterion is used to exhibit a primitive invertible substitution with a non-free Schützenberger group, disproving a result proposed by Almeida. Some early results are also obtained on the topic of relative freeness. <p>

The second part of the thesis examines the pronilpotent quotients of Schützenberger groups of primitive substitutions. The main result is a description of the maximal pronilpotent quotients of ω-presented groups, of which Schützenberger groups of primitive substitutions are special cases. We show that all the information about the pronilpotent quotients of a given ω-presented group can be extracted from the characteristic polynomial of a certain matrix. This can be used, for instance, to show that ω-presented groups are never pro-p groups (partially answering a question of Zalesskii), and that they are perfect only under strict conditions which exclude Schützenberger groups of primitive substitutions. These results also lead to a number of necessary conditions for absolute and relative freeness of ω-presented groups. We deduce that Schützenberger groups of primitive aperiodic substitutions of constant length are never absolutely free. <p>

The last part of the thesis is devoted to a study of the subgroups generated by return words in minimal shift spaces. In 2016, Almeida and Costa showed that the collective behaviour of these subgroups can be used to gather information about the Schützenberger group. Their results were motivated in part by a series of papers initiated in 2015 by Berthé et al., which developed a number of ideas centred around the notion of <i>extension graphs</i>. Under certain assumptions, Berthé et al.'s results allowed for a complete understanding of the subgroups generated by return words. Our main contribution on this topic is a new condition called <i>suffix-connectedness</i>, which allows to generalize some of these results. Various applications of suffix-connectedness to the study of Schützenberger groups are also highlighted.
